# 🐳 Telemetry Microservices - Containerization Demo

This repository demonstrates a partial containerization of a telemetry-based microservices application.  
The original application contains 20+ services written in different languages.  
Here, I have containerized **three services only**, for demo and learning purposes:

- `ad` (Java)
- `product-catalog` (Go)
- `recommendation` (Python)

Each service includes its own `Dockerfile` and can be built and run separately.
